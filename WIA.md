## Women In AppSec - Ladies-only Evening event! 

This special mentoring and career advice event, for female & female-identifying attendees only, will take place after the [Training Day](Training) on {{ site.trainingday }}.   
We expect the event to start at 17:30, and last for 2-3 hours. 

This event will be divided into two parts:  

Part 1: Everything you need to know to get your career started in Cyber Security and Web Application Security.  
   Including practical tips for gaining relevant knowledge, creating a good network, nailing job interviews and more!
   
Part 2: Networking and mentoring with our amazing female-mentors.  
   This is a great chance to meet leaders from the Israeli Cyber security and Tech industry, to ask questions and to get important tips.

Whether you're a student, a fresh graduate or already working in the industry, this event is for you!
