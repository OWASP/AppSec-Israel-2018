## Call for Training

### What are we looking for? 

We are calling for trainers to support the Israeli AppSec community and submit proposals to deliver this training.   
The format has changed slightly this year and we are looking for several trainers to deliver hands-on, workshop-style training lasting between 1.5 and 3 hours.   
We would also be interested in proposals for a full day of training.   
The training will be a single track and we are expecting over 400 developers.   

Topics we are interesting in seeing in proposals include:

- Workshops on common (OWASP Top 10 2017) attacks and their mitigations
- Secure development with modern paradigms such as Single Page Applications and WebSockets.
- General application security mechanisms
- Secure coding guidelines

The CFT team will select the training based on content, quality of submission, and expertise of trainer(s), and are completely independent of any vendor or sponsor support. 

However, preference will be given to submissions which:

- Make use of OWASP projects as part of the workshops
- Provide content and exercises which the attendees can take home with them
- Refer to modern technologies such as (but not limited to) node.js, Go, Python, Scala
- Have a strong interactive and hands-on focus
