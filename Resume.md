## Resume Review / CV Critique

We have seen many talented young professionals in the AppSec field (and some not so young) miss out on great opportunities in which they would excel, and bring amazing value to their employers. Often, this is happens because of a lackluster resume or CV, which does not properly showcase their talent and abilities.  

After last year's success, we will help you improve your resume, and offer tips to better show off what you can do - and get you in the door at the right employer.  

The Workshop will take place in the afternoon, starting from lunchtime. [Please register on the workshop session](https://appsecisrael2018.sched.com/event/GAWR/). 

*Remember to bring your resume or CV with you!* (Preferably paper printout, as that is easier to review).
