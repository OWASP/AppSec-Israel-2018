## Call for Training

### What are we looking for? 

We are calling for trainers to support the Israeli AppSec community and submit proposals to deliver this training.   
The format has changed slightly this year and we are looking for several trainers to deliver hands-on, workshop-style training lasting between 1.5 and 3 hours.   
We would also be interested in proposals for a full day of training.   
The training will be a single track and we are expecting over 400 developers.   

Topics we are interesting in seeing in proposals include:

- Workshops on common (OWASP Top 10 2017) attacks and their mitigations
- Secure development with modern paradigms such as Single Page Applications and WebSockets.
- General application security mechanisms
- Secure coding guidelines

The CFT team will select the training based on content, quality of submission, and expertise of trainer(s), and are completely independent of any vendor or sponsor support. 

However, preference will be given to submissions which:

- Make use of OWASP projects as part of the workshops
- Provide content and exercises which the attendees can take home with them
- Refer to modern technologies such as (but not limited to) node.js, Go, Python, Scala
- Have a strong interactive and hands-on focus

### Travel Assistance 

We are working to dedicate a travel assistance budget for those that require it.  

As a free community event with no profit, we rely on our sponsors to cover all our costs, including free food and drinks all day long. Unfortunately this means we do not have an unlimited budget for all speakers, but if you need assistance we will be able to help cover part of your costs of travel and accommodation.  

However we are limited in how many speakers we can offer to cover, so if you work for a company that can afford to pay for your travel, we will be happy to grant them a Community Supporter sponsorship in recognition. If your company will not (or cannot) cover your travel, we will work with you upon acceptance to ensure you do not incur large expenses to come speak at our conference.  

**This will not affect your acceptance at all. We will not expect you to confirm attendance before we confirm how much assistance we can offer.**  

Additionally, we will cover expenses for training materials such as: printing, disk-on-keys (if needed) or any other reasonable expenses that are required for the training.
