# Other Activities

This year we will be hosting several activities, in addition to the regular lecture tracks: a Capture the Flag (CtF) competition, a resume review workshop, and a passport raffle. 

## Resume Review / CV Critique

We have seen many talented young professionals in the AppSec field (and some not so young) miss out on great opportunities in which they would excel, and bring amazing value to their employers. Often, this is happens because of a lackluster resume or CV, which does not properly showcase their talent and abilities.  

After last year's success, we will help you improve your resume, and offer tips to better show off what you can do - and get you in the door at the right employer.  

*Remember to bring your resume or CV with you!* (Preferably paper printout, as that is easier to review). 


## Capture The Flag


The conference is around the corner, it is time to sharpen your minds and prepare for the CTF!


This year, professionals from various places, led by Tomer Zait (F5 networks) and Nimrod Levy (Scorpiones) worked hard to create a new, interesting, unique challenge, all in the field of application security.


So, if you feel like giving it a try, make sure to sign up (with a valid email address) in the following link:

The challenge will be opened on Wednesday, September 5th, at 10am.


Good Luck :)
