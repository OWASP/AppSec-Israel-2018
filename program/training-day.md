Following last year's training day success, this year there will also be a training day. For who and what? Here are the details:


The training day will take place on September 5th in Bar-Shira Auditorium of the Tel Aviv University.


The training day is intended for developers that would like to get acquainted with application security.

The day will start with more "basic" skills and become more advanced throughout the day.


A small teaser is that the keynote speaker for the conference, Jim Manico, will also be giving a training session!
