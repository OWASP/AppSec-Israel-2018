### Membership 

While you are here, please consider [joining OWASP as an individual member](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Individual_Member).   
As a not-for-profit organization, OWASP has no direct income other than sponsorships and membership fees.  
For only **50 USD**, you can support this organization, help ensure we can continue to deliver great content,  
and you also get various member benefits (including a 50 USD discount for Global Conferences).  
[Learn more about OWASP and membership benefits](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Individual_Member).  
And don't forget to specify the Israel chapter when you join! This will allocate a small portion of your membership fee to the running of the Israel chapter, and mark your account as associated with the Israel chapter. And you'll get a small gift at the conference, a token of our appreciation!  

The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is an open-source, not-for-profit application security
