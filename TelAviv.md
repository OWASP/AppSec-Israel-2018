# Tel Aviv 
If this is your first time visiting Tel Aviv, or especially Israel in general, you may be interested in some local information. 

## About Tel Aviv  

Ever since the establishment of the State of Israel, Tel Aviv, Israel’s largest city, has served as the financial, entertainment, and cultural center of the country. Founded in 1909 and built on the sand dunes that stretch northward from the old city of Jaffa, Tel Aviv lies on a beautiful beach strip of the Mediterranean.   

Tel Aviv abounds with hotels, museums, galleries, theatres and entertainment venues, markets, shopping malls, restaurants, bars and outdoor cafes, all bustling with nonstop active day and night.   

Typical of so much of Israel, Tel Aviv juxtaposes the old and the new. The old port of Jaffa, with its colorful artists’ quarter and flea market, reflects the special atmosphere of ancient times, while the modern hotels, skyscrapers and busy shopping malls, portray the brisk vibrant city life.   

A modern cultural center, Tel Aviv, boasts many fine art galleries, entertainment centers and museums like the multi-media at the Jewish Diaspora Museum. The world famous Israel Philharmonic Orchestra performs at the Mann Auditorium, next to Israel’s Habima National Theater. The Golda Meir Center for Performing Arts is home to Israel opera, dance companies, theater companies and concerts, and the Suzanne Dellal Dance Center, situated in the old Neve Zedek Quarter of the city, offers exciting programs.   

Apart from the open air markets and shopping malls, popular street shopping areas like the bohemian Sheinkin Street and Neve Zedek, portray the newest trends in fashion and styles. Tel Aviv is a perfect choice for international visitors, and affords a great opportunity to enjoy the vibrant spirit of the city.
